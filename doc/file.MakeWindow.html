<h1 id="label-Making+windows+in+Groundhog">Making windows in Groundhog</h1>

<p>The whole idea here is to make a window that Groundhog actually identifies
as a window. This, as explained in
the <a
href="http://file.GettingStarted.html">Getting Started</a> section, will be
important when exporting the model to Radiance.</p>

<p>For doing this, you have to select the surface (or multiple surfaces) and
right-click on it. Then, you must
choose &quot;Label as Window&quot; option
in the context menu. After doing that the color will change to a
semi-transparent
blue, but remember you can assign different materials to
it. You should take care of the normal of the surface you
transform. This
affects the Three and Five phase method implementations.</p>

<h2 id="label-Window+groups">Window groups</h2>

<p>When performing annual daylighting simulations, it might be very useful and
efficient to
group windows and treat them as if they were only one. This is
a feature that was planned from the beginning
of Groundhog development and
is now a reality.</p>

<p>This can be easily done by right-clicking two or more selected windows.
Groundhog will ask
for a name for the group (i.e. &#39;Kitchen south-facing
windows&#39; or &#39;First floor east windows&#39;), which will be
lately
used for naming the files when exporting in &quot;Groundhog
distribution&quot;. Windows without groups will be exported
in files using
their names (assigned by right-click --&gt; assign name). It a window does
not have a group or a name,
it will be exported by assigning a generic
name. This is not recommended, since it is difficult to recognize
different
windows by the content of the .rad file.</p>

<p>There is a button in the Groundhog Toolbar that allows seeing the groups.
This button assigns
random colors to each group, and is deactivated like
any other tool (i.e. by pressing the space-bar). When
deactivated,
everything goes back to normal and the previous materials are
assigned.</p>
