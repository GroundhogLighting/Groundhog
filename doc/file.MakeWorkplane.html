<h1 id="label-Including+workplanes+into+the+model">Including workplanes into the model</h1>

<p>Including workplanes into the model will be useful for obtaining numerical
(quantitative) results such as
annual simulations, daylight factors and
other results.</p>

<p>Workplanes will be shown as a semi-transparent red surface, although this
surface is labeled as
&quot;Workplane&quot;, and will not be exported to
the Radiance model as a surface. Actually, at the moment of exporting, you
will
be asked for the spacing of the workplane sensors.</p>

<p>Workplanes need to be horizontal and rectangular surfaces with no holes.</p>

<h2 id="label-Including+a+workplane">Including a workplane</h2>

<h3 id="label-Step+1%3A+Draw+a+surface+that+you+want+to+be+a+Workplane">Step 1: Draw a surface that you want to be a Workplane</h3>

<p>This surface has to be rectangular, horizontal and cannot have any holes</p>

<h4 id="label-Figure+1%3A+First+step+-+Draw+a+rectangle+that+you+want+to+become+a+Workplane">Figure 1: First step - Draw a rectangle that you want to become a Workplane</h4>

<h3 id="label-Step+2%3A+Right+click+the+surface.">Step 2: Right click the surface.</h3>

<p>When right clicking, look for “Label as workplane” in the Context menu, and
click it.</p>

<h3 id="label-Step+3%3A+Write+the+name+of+the+workplace">Step 3: Write the name of the workplace</h3>

<p>The idea is to give it a reasonable name as “Office desk” or “hallway”.
This name will be used when exporting sensors.

<h4 id="label-Figure+3%3A+Third+step+-+Assign+a+name+to+the+workplane">Figure 3: Third step - Assign a name to the workplane</h4>

<h3 id="label-Step+4%3A+Move+it+to+choose+the+final+location">Step 4: Move it to choose the final location</h3>

<p>The workplace can be moved and modified. You should notice that rotating it
might end in errors.</p>

<h3 id="label-Step+5%3A+Choose+the+spacing+of+the+sensors">Step 5: Choose the spacing of the sensors</h3>

<p>This will be done at the moment of exporting the model.</p>

<h3 id="label-Notes">Notes</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>More than one surface can be labeled as Workplane at the same time. The
assigned name will be “Name_1”, “Name_2, etc
 where &#39;Name&#39;
corresponds to what the user introduced as the name</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Final+location+of+the+sensors">Final location of the sensors</h2>

<p>There are a couple of things to know of where will the sensors finally be.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The sensor spacing you define when exporting will be slightly modified in
order to allow an exact division of the workplane and allow a uniform
distribution</p>
</li><li>
<p>The previous point is done in both directions of the workplane, so the
spacing in both direction will be similar, but not exactly the same</p>
</li><li>
<p>Margins are left in the border of the workplane. These margin correspond to
one half of the spacing on each direction. This allow drawing the results
correctly when importing results</p>
</li></ul>
