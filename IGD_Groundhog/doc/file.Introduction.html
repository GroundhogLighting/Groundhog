<h1 id="label-What+is+Groundhog%3F">What is Groundhog?</h1>

<p>Groundhog is a SketchUp extension that intends to simplify the creation of
geometry, workplanes,
views and simulations made in Radiance. Its
development started during Germán Molina´s M.Sc. thesis (Molina, 2014),
under
the advice of Sergio Vera Ph.D and Waldo Bustamante Ph.D. The tesis
was focused on performing integrated lighting and
thermal simulations of
spaces with complex fenestration systems using &lt;a href=&quot;<a
href="http://www.radiance-online.org">Radiance</a">www.radiance-online.org">Radiance</a</a>&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&quot;<a
href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus">apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus</a>/&quot;&gt;
EnergyPlus&lt;/a&gt;. When starting that thesis, and when trying
to learn
Radiance, we found it hard to create geometry, add workplanes and assign
materials, especially for big scenes. Also,
since our intention was to
perform these simulations for spaces with Complex Fenestration Systems
(CFS), we wanted a “geometry
generator” that could not only export all
polygons, but also know what polygon was a window, which one as an “illum”
and which
one was a workplane, and export them in a distribution that was
comfortable to work with later. Accordingly, Groundhog is focused
on
exporting models for implementing methods such as the &lt;a href=&quot;<a
href="http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/Tutorial-ThreePhaseMethod.pdf">www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/Tutorial-ThreePhaseMethod.pdf</a>&quot;&gt;
Three-phase&lt;/a&gt;
and the &lt;a href=&quot;<a
href="http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/fivephasetutorialfiles/Tutorial-FivePhaseMethod_v2.pdf">www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/fivephasetutorialfiles/Tutorial-FivePhaseMethod_v2.pdf</a>&quot;&gt;
Five-phase&lt;/a&gt;
methods. However, it also exports models for ray-tracing and rendering,
allowing using your own materials
from a library.</p>

<p>That said, Groundhog intends to simplify scene creation and modeling. It,
for now, allows:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Working with thick walls.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Exporting complex polygons as one polygon (window openings are not a
problem).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Assigning materials from a library of auto-contained Radiance Material
files.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Materials not existing in the library will be “guessed” by defining a
plastic material with no specularity or roughness, with the same color. If
the material is semi-transparent, a colored glass material will be
assigned.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Adding workplanes, which will be exported as a set of sensors that can be
used by rcontrib and rtrace programs.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Adding Illums.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Grouping windows in order to make more efficient lighting simulations.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Exporting by layers, separating the windows from the rest of the geometry.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Export views from Scenes saved within SketchUp.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Every exported file comes with a CIE clear sky with the sun located
according to the sun direction in the model.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Exporting Groups and Components in separated file.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Exporting a “RIF” file for rendering</p>
</li></ul>

<p>On the other hand, Groundhog intends to use SketchUp capabilities as much
as possible, like its material libraries, scenes (saved views),
geolocation, time and date, layers, solar position. Accordingly,
“workplanes” and “illums” are just another surface that is labeled, so the
user can move them, create them, name them and delete them easily.</p>

<h2 id="label-Origin+of+the+name">Origin of the name</h2>

<p>Even though there are many words that are related to this plugin (sun,
solar, shading, windows, simulation, energy, names of people, sun in
different languages, etc.), Groundhog was named after the “Groundhog Day”
tradition.
The Groundhog Day tradition has nothing to do with my country,
Chile, but I heard about it during an internship in Canada, and I found it
to be an interesting name.</p>
