<h1 id="label-Exporting+Groups+and+Components">Exporting Groups and Components</h1>

<h2 id="label-About+groups+and+components">About groups and components</h2>

<p>Groundhog treats Groups and Components just as SketchUp does… that is, each
group and component
will be exported in its own file, with its own
materials, and then &#39;xformed&#39; into another file in order to
position it
somewhere... there are sutil diferences, though, and they are
explain below.</p>

<p>A Group is, well, a group of elements that are tied together. You can
group, for example,
a set of luminaires or furniture. Then, you can copy
and paste the whole group, move it around, delete it, etc.</p>

<p>Components, on the other hand, can be thought as groups that are meant to
be repeated
a number of times and that will always be equal. For example,
an office may have 15 chairs, and they will
all be the same. In this case,
it makes little sense to export the same chair 15 times. On the
contrary,
it is better to export it just once and then tell Radiance that
we are including that chair in different
locations and orientations within
the Office. Accordingly, Components will be exported just once in an
exlusive
file and then included into the main &#39;scene.rad&#39; or
another group or component file by using the Radiance&#39;s
&#39;!xform&#39;
command.</p>

<p>Nested components or groups (components or groups that lay within another
component) will be
“!xformed” inside the definition of the parent component
(i.e. within the .rad file located in the corresponding
directory). First
level components (components that are not inside any other component), on
the other hand, will
be “!xformed” in the scene file. Play a little with
this.</p>

<h2 id="label-How+to+use+this+little+difference">How to use this little difference</h2>

<p>Replacing 10 equivalent groups by one component can save space time and
space. Space since the
&#39;xform&#39; command used to place it in other
files is much smaller than re-writing the same object again and again.
And
time since any modification made on the component file will be repeated
in all of its instances, thus saving us modelling time.</p>

<h3 id="label-Notes">Notes</h3>

<p>Windows, Illums and Workplanes that are placed within components or groups
are totally ignored when exporting.</p>
