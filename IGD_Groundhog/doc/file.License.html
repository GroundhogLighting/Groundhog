    <div id="content"><div id='filecontents'>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>==========================<br/><br/>Version 3, 29 June 2007<br/><br/>Copyright &amp;copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &amp;lt;&lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;&amp;gt;<br/><br/>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license<br/>document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/><br/>## Preamble<br/><br/>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other<br/>kinds of works.<br/><br/>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away<br/>your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br/>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a<br/>program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free<br/>Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it<br/>applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to<br/>your programs, too.<br/><br/>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General<br/>Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute<br/>copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source<br/>code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of<br/>it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br/><br/>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or<br/>asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if<br/>you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to<br/>respect the freedom of others.<br/><br/>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,<br/>you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make<br/>sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these<br/>terms so they know their rights.<br/><br/>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert<br/>copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission<br/>to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br/><br/>For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is<br/>no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39; sake, the GPL<br/>requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not<br/>be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.<br/><br/>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of<br/>the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally<br/>incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The<br/>systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br/>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed<br/>this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems<br/>arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to<br/>those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of<br/>users.<br/><br/>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should<br/>not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose<br/>computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents<br/>applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the<br/>GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br/><br/>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.<br/><br/>## TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>### 0. Definitions.<br/><br/>&amp;ldquo;This License&amp;rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br/><br/>&amp;ldquo;Copyright&amp;rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br/>works, such as semiconductor masks.<br/><br/>&amp;ldquo;The Program&amp;rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br/>License. Each licensee is addressed as &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Licensees&amp;rdquo; and<br/>&amp;ldquo;recipients&amp;rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.<br/><br/>To &amp;ldquo;modify&amp;rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in<br/>a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The<br/>resulting work is called a &amp;ldquo;modified version&amp;rdquo; of the earlier work or a<br/>work &amp;ldquo;based on&amp;rdquo; the earlier work.<br/><br/>A &amp;ldquo;covered work&amp;rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based on<br/>the Program.<br/><br/>To &amp;ldquo;propagate&amp;rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without<br/>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under<br/>applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private<br/>copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),<br/>making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br/><br/>To &amp;ldquo;convey&amp;rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br/>parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer<br/>network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br/><br/>An interactive user interface displays &amp;ldquo;Appropriate Legal Notices&amp;rdquo; to the<br/>extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)<br/>displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no<br/>warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that<br/>licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this<br/>License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br/>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br/><br/>### 1. Source Code.<br/><br/>The &amp;ldquo;source code&amp;rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br/>making modifications to it. &amp;ldquo;Object code&amp;rdquo; means any non-source form of a<br/>work.<br/><br/>A &amp;ldquo;Standard Interface&amp;rdquo; means an interface that either is an official<br/>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces<br/>specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among<br/>developers working in that language.<br/><br/>The &amp;ldquo;System Libraries&amp;rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other than<br/>the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major<br/>Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to<br/>enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard<br/>Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.<br/>A &amp;ldquo;Major Component&amp;rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential component<br/>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which<br/>the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code<br/>interpreter used to run it.<br/><br/>The &amp;ldquo;Corresponding Source&amp;rdquo; for a work in object code form means all the<br/>source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object<br/>code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However,<br/>it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or<br/>generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those<br/>activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source<br/>includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and<br/>the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work<br/>is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or<br/>control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.<br/><br/>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate<br/>automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.<br/><br/>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.<br/><br/>### 2. Basic Permissions.<br/><br/>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the<br/>Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License<br/>explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The<br/>output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,<br/>given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights<br/>of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br/><br/>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without<br/>conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered<br/>works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively<br/>for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you<br/>comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not<br/>control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so<br/>exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit<br/>them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship<br/>with you.<br/><br/>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions<br/>stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.<br/><br/>### 3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br/><br/>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any<br/>applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty<br/>adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention<br/>of such measures.<br/><br/>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of<br/>technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising<br/>rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any<br/>intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,<br/>against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention<br/>of technological measures.<br/><br/>### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br/><br/>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any<br/>medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br/>appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and<br/>any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep<br/>intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of<br/>this License along with the Program.<br/><br/>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer<br/>support or warranty protection for a fee.<br/><br/>### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br/><br/>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from<br/>the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that<br/>you also meet all of these conditions:<br/><br/>* **a)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a<br/>relevant date.<br/>* **b)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this<br/>License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the<br/>requirement in section 4 to &amp;ldquo;keep intact all notices&amp;rdquo;.<br/>* **c)** You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who<br/>comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any<br/>applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br/>regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the<br/>work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have<br/>separately received it.<br/>* **d)** If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal<br/>Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display<br/>Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.<br/><br/>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are<br/>not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with<br/>it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution<br/>medium, is called an &amp;ldquo;aggregate&amp;rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting<br/>copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users<br/>beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate<br/>does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.<br/><br/>### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br/><br/>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and<br/>5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the<br/>terms of this License, in one of these ways:<br/><br/>* **a)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a<br/>physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a<br/>durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.<br/>* **b)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a<br/>physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least<br/>three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for<br/>that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of<br/>the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this<br/>License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for<br/>a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of<br/>source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no<br/>charge.<br/>* **c)** Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to<br/>provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and<br/>noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in<br/>accord with subsection 6b.<br/>* **d)** Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for<br/>a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way<br/>through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy<br/>the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object<br/>code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server<br/>(operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities,<br/>provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find<br/>the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,<br/>you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy<br/>these requirements.<br/>* **e)** Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform<br/>other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being<br/>offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.<br/><br/>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the<br/>Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the<br/>object code work.<br/><br/>A &amp;ldquo;User Product&amp;rdquo; is either (1) a &amp;ldquo;consumer product&amp;rdquo;, which<br/>means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or<br/>household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a<br/>dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases<br/>shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a<br/>particular user, &amp;ldquo;normally used&amp;rdquo; refers to a typical or common use of<br/>that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way<br/>in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the<br/>product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has<br/>substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br/>the only significant mode of use of the product.<br/><br/>&amp;ldquo;Installation Information&amp;rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,<br/>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute<br/>modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of<br/>its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued<br/>functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with<br/>solely because modification has been made.<br/><br/>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for<br/>use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which<br/>the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient<br/>in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is<br/>characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be<br/>accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if<br/>neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code<br/>on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).<br/><br/>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to<br/>continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been<br/>modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been<br/>modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself<br/>materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules<br/>and protocols for communication across the network.<br/><br/>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with<br/>this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an<br/>implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no<br/>special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.<br/><br/>### 7. Additional Terms.<br/><br/>&amp;ldquo;Additional permissions&amp;rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of this<br/>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional<br/>permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they<br/>were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable<br/>law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be<br/>used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br/>this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br/><br/>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any<br/>additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional<br/>permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you<br/>modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a<br/>covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a<br/>covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)<br/>supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br/><br/>* **a)** Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of<br/>sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br/>* **b)** Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author<br/>attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works<br/>containing it; or<br/>* **c)** Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that<br/>modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the<br/>original version; or<br/>* **d)** Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the<br/>material; or<br/>* **e)** Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,<br/>trademarks, or service marks; or<br/>* **f)** Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone<br/>who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of<br/>liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions<br/>directly impose on those licensors and authors.<br/><br/>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &amp;ldquo;further<br/>restrictions&amp;rdquo; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received<br/>it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License<br/>along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a<br/>license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying<br/>under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of<br/>that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such<br/>relicensing or conveying.<br/><br/>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in<br/>the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those<br/>files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.<br/><br/>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a<br/>separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply<br/>either way.<br/><br/>### 8. Termination.<br/><br/>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under<br/>this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will<br/>automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses<br/>granted under the third paragraph of section 11).<br/><br/>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a<br/>particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the<br/>copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently,<br/>if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br/>prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br/><br/>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently<br/>if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this<br/>is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any<br/>work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br/>your receipt of the notice.<br/><br/>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of<br/>parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your<br/>rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to<br/>receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.<br/><br/>### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br/><br/>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the<br/>Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of<br/>using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require<br/>acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to<br/>propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not<br/>accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you<br/>indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br/><br/>### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br/><br/>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license<br/>from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this<br/>License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this<br/>License.<br/><br/>An &amp;ldquo;entity transaction&amp;rdquo; is a transaction transferring control of an<br/>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or<br/>merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity<br/>transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also<br/>receives whatever licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or<br/>could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br/>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor<br/>has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br/><br/>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or<br/>affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty,<br/>or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not<br/>initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging<br/>that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or<br/>importing the Program or any portion of it.<br/><br/>### 11. Patents.<br/><br/>A &amp;ldquo;contributor&amp;rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br/>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus<br/>licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &amp;ldquo;contributor version&amp;rdquo;.<br/><br/>A contributor&#39;s &amp;ldquo;essential patent claims&amp;rdquo; are all patent claims owned or<br/>controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that<br/>would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or<br/>selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed<br/>only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For<br/>purposes of this definition, &amp;ldquo;control&amp;rdquo; includes the right to grant patent<br/>sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.<br/><br/>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license<br/>under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale,<br/>import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor<br/>version.<br/><br/>In the following three paragraphs, a &amp;ldquo;patent license&amp;rdquo; is any express<br/>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an<br/>express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent<br/>infringement). To &amp;ldquo;grant&amp;rdquo; such a patent license to a party means to make<br/>such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.<br/><br/>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the<br/>Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge<br/>and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or<br/>other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding<br/>Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br/>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with<br/>the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream<br/>recipients. &amp;ldquo;Knowingly relying&amp;rdquo; means you have actual knowledge that, but<br/>for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your<br/>recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more<br/>identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br/><br/>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you<br/>convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent<br/>license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,<br/>propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent<br/>license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and<br/>works based on it.<br/><br/>A patent license is &amp;ldquo;discriminatory&amp;rdquo; if it does not include within the<br/>scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the<br/>non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this<br/>License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with<br/>a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make<br/>payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the<br/>work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive<br/>the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with<br/>copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b)<br/>primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain<br/>the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license<br/>was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br/><br/>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied<br/>license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you<br/>under applicable patent law.<br/><br/>### 12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.<br/><br/>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)<br/>that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the<br/>conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy<br/>simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent<br/>obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you<br/>agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from<br/>those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms<br/>and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br/><br/>### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or<br/>combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero<br/>General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.<br/>The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered<br/>work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section<br/>13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.<br/><br/>### 14. Revised Versions of this License.<br/><br/>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU<br/>General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit<br/>to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br/><br/>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that<br/>a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License &amp;ldquo;or any later<br/>version&amp;rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br/>conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the<br/>Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU<br/>General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free<br/>Software Foundation.<br/><br/>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU<br/>General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a<br/>version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.<br/><br/>Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no<br/>additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of<br/>your choosing to follow a later version.<br/><br/>### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br/><br/>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br/>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br/>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;ldquo;AS IS&amp;rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER<br/>EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br/>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE<br/>QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE<br/>DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/><br/>### 16. Limitation of Liability.<br/><br/>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY<br/>COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS<br/>PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,<br/>INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br/>PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE<br/>OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE<br/>WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br/>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/><br/>### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br/><br/>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be<br/>given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local<br/>law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in<br/>connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies<br/>a copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br/><br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br/><br/>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to<br/>the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone<br/>can redistribute and change under these terms.<br/><br/>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them<br/>to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty;<br/>and each file should have at least the &amp;ldquo;copyright&amp;rdquo; line and a pointer to<br/>where the full notice is found.<br/><br/>    &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br/>    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br/><br/>    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br/>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br/>    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br/>    (at your option) any later version.<br/><br/>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br/>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br/>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br/>    GNU General Public License for more details.<br/><br/>    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br/>    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br/><br/>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br/><br/>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this<br/>when it starts in an interactive mode:<br/><br/>    &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br/>    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type &#39;show w&#39;.<br/>    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br/>    under certain conditions; type &#39;show c&#39; for details.<br/><br/>The hypothetical commands &#39;show w&#39; and &#39;show c&#39; should show the appropriate parts of<br/>the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands might be different;<br/>for a GUI interface, you would use an &amp;ldquo;about box&amp;rdquo;.<br/><br/>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to<br/>sign a &amp;ldquo;copyright disclaimer&amp;rdquo; for the program, if necessary. For more<br/>information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br/>&amp;lt;&lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;&amp;gt;.<br/><br/>The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br/>proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it<br/>more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is<br/>what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this<br/>License. But first, please read<br/>&amp;lt;&lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;&amp;gt;.</div></div>
