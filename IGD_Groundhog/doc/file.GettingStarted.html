<h1 id="label-Understanding+Groundhog">Understanding Groundhog</h1>

<p>The following sections reference some <a
href="http://www.radiance-online.org">Radiance</a>
programs and conceptual
elements. It is assumed that you have some (not really advanced) knowledge
about those topics.</p>

<p>Groundhog intends to use as much as possible the main SketchUp
features.
This allows using other SketchUp geometry-generating-plugins and
still be able to export to
Radiance. You can even download models from the
3D Warehouse (some complex models will include &quot;non planar&quot;
faces...
in my experience, I just erase them, and the model is usually not
affected).</p>

<p>Internally, Groundhog only analyzes SketchUp surfaces (<a
href="http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/docs/ourdoc/face.php">faces</a>),
and
<a
href="http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/docs/ourdoc/group#definition">Groups</a>
and <a
href="http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/docs/ourdoc/componentdefinition">Components</a>,
and
only exports Radiance polygons (which will not only be triangles, but more
complex
polygons as well). Groundhog always exports in one distribution
(i.e. set of files and folders)
making a difference between Windows,
Workplanes, Illums and other kinds of surfaces. This distribution
is the
one I use, and keeping it constant helps creating scripts for accelerating
Daylight analysis,
and avoiding errors.</p>

<p>The following section explains what are and how Groundhog identifies
different kinds of
surfaces in the scene, and how the two different
exporting options deal with such components.</p>

<h2 id="label-Different+kinds+of+surfaces%3A+Labels">Different kinds of surfaces: Labels</h2>

<p>As was explained earlier, Groundhog will only export SketchUp&#39;s faces
(including those within components and groups).
Such faces may be of
different classes, such as illum, window, workplane and &quot;the
rest&quot;.</p>

<p>In order to be light, fast and easy to use, Groundhog “Labels” the
different polygons in the
scene by using SketchUp&#39;s <a
href="http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/docs/ourdoc/entity.php#set_attribute">set_attribute</a>
and
<a
href="http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/docs/ourdoc/entity.php#get_attribute">get_attribute</a>

API methods. This allows the user to delete, move, create and split
workplanes, illums and windows with the tools provided by SketchUp.
For
example, if a workplane has been defined within the model, dividing it (by
drawing a line within it) or copying and pasting it
will result in the
existence of two workplanes. In the same way, deleting it will make the
workplane disappear without the need
of going through complex internal data
structures.</p>
