<h1 id="label-Groundhog+History">Groundhog History</h1>

<p>This just intends to show a little bit of how Groundhog has been developed.</p>

<h2 id="label-Groundhog+0.9">Groundhog 0.9</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Integration of Artificial lighting (validation and documentation has not
been done)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Configuration is now automatically saved when closing the WebDialog.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Terrain is automatically added according to the size of the model</p>
</li><li>
<p>Groundhog now allows working with several metrics at the same time.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Groundhog+0.8">Groundhog 0.8</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Add-on environment is initiated (0.7.1)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Bug fixing and enhancements (0.7.2)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Started the integration of Support Files. Now you can insert an Irradiance
sensor.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Groundhog+0.7">Groundhog 0.7</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Annual simulation is provided by using simple DC method</p>
</li><li>
<p>Simulation GUI incorporated</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enhanced Configuration</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Groundhog+0.6">Groundhog 0.6</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Exporting distributions were unified into a unique one that places illums
of each layer in a separate file and window groups in other files.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Groups are now exported as if they were components.</p>
</li><li>
<p>SketchUp 2015 is now considered the required SketchUp version</p>
</li><li>
<p>Added a RIF file exporter to simplify rendering.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Workplanes now need to be rectangular and have no holes.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Importing results for visualizing them within SketchUp.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The concept of “value” was incorporated.</p>
</li><li>
<p>All tools, features and functions are now grouped under the same menu:
Plugins (extensions) –&gt; Groundhog</p>
</li><li>
<p>Local materials were introduced. These are materials that contain their
whole Radiance definition as their value</p>
</li><li>
<p>Eliminated duplicity of materials. Now the same material may be exported a
number of times (one for each component or group on which is used), but
every time with different names.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Sky is exported separately</p>
</li><li>
<p>Basic materials can now be created from within SketchUp… avoiding some
post-processing.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Bug fixing, testing on Windows and OSX.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Groundhog+0.5">Groundhog 0.5</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>The “show/hide” tools were moved from the Groundhog Toolbar to the View
menu.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The “Show Window Groups” tool was algo moved to the View Menu.</p>
</li><li>
<p>It is now possible to export a model without saving it as well as saving it
in a different directory.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The “Add Workplane” tool was downgraded to a simple script. It is more
comfortable since the user no longer has to write down the height of the
Worplane. The Workplanes may be moved just as any other face.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Added the “Label as workplane” Context Menu. The faces have to be
horizontal.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Window Groups and Workplanes require a name. This name will be used for
exporting them.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Components may now be exported. Even Nested components (components within
components) seem to be working OK. Groups are trickier.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Groundhog+0.4">Groundhog 0.4</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Groundhog seem to be working O.K. on SketchUp 2014</p>
</li><li>
<p>Materials can be supported by *.mat file stored on a directory… if not,
they are guessed.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Exporting groups and one-level components is supported (components within
components do not really work… needed?)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Wrapped “Make Window” and “Add Workplane” operations into one “Undo”…
better and more comfortable.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Groundhog+0.3">Groundhog 0.3</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Materials started to be supported, as well as SketchUp Components (non of
them is ready yet).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Although windows can still be grouped, the groups can´t be seen, since
“materials” (i.e. colors) mean something now. We need to solve this.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The project was completely reorganized, introducing classes… Then, it was
published.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Groundhog+0.2">Groundhog 0.2</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Change of paradigm. Groundhog intends to export well, for now. In the
future we might simulate within SketchUp.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Grouping of windows option was added, as well as showing them in different
colors.</p>
</li><li>
<p>“Winfo” and “SimFile” files do not exist any more.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Groundhog is now an extension, that can be turned on or off inside
SketchUp.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Groundhog+0.1">Groundhog 0.1</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Project started as part of Germán Molina´s MSc. thesis, under the advice of
Sergio Vera
Ph.D and Waldo Bustamante, Ph.D, at the school of Engineering
of Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Exports into Radiance and 3phase method formats.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Calculations have to be done from a “Window Information File” and a
“Simulation File”, using perl scripts outside SketchUp.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Materials are not supported at all. The program exports a list of assigned
modifiers, and they have to be filled by the user.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Sensor location is done over the workplane… the location is shown by
drawing two lines forming an X.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Sensor location involves ray-casting… which is very inefficient.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Materials are treated separated from CFS.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Grouping windows was not yet supported.</p>
</li></ul>
