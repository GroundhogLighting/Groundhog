<h1 id="label-Groundhog+List+of+labels">Groundhog List of labels</h1>

<p>As you might have read, it is very important for Groundhog to know if a
surface is a Workplane, an Illum,
a Window or other things. This is
because, depending on what they are, they they will be exported in
different ways.
For example, you do not want a Workplane (which is meant to
be a plane in space where you want to calculate
different values) to be
exported as a real surface that will be actually seen in your renders.</p>

<h2 id="label-Face+%28surface%29+Labels">Face (surface) Labels</h2>

<h3 id="label-Windows">Windows</h3>

<p>Even though it is not necessary to identify windows as “special elements”
when we want
to make a render, there are some other cases where it is very
convenient to export them separately. In order
to achieve this
identification, Groundhog can internally tell (from its Label) if a surface
is a window or not,
and export it separatly.</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='kw'>if</span> <span class='const'>GH_Labeler</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_window?'>window?</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_face'>face</span><span class='rparen'>)</span> <span class='kw'>then</span>
	<span class='comment'>#face is a window
</span><span class='kw'>else</span>
	<span class='comment'>#face is not a window
</span><span class='kw'>end</span></code></pre>

<h3 id="label-Workplanes">Workplanes</h3>

<p>Workplanes are planes of the space where we would like to measure the
illuminance or luminance
levels. Even though in a Groundhog-created
SketchUp model the workplanes will be represented as a (semi-transparent
red)
 surface, it will be exported as a sensor grid in a file that
represent such sensors in a format that can be used with
 Radiance&#39;s <a
href="http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/rcontrib.pdf">RCONTRIB</a>

and <a
href="http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/rtrace.pdf">RTRACE</a>
programs.</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='kw'>if</span> <span class='const'>GH_Labeler</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_workplane?'>workplane?</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_face'>face</span><span class='rparen'>)</span> <span class='kw'>then</span>
	<span class='comment'>#face is a workplane
</span><span class='kw'>else</span>
	<span class='comment'>#face is not a workplane
</span><span class='kw'>end</span></code></pre>

<h3 id="label-Illum+surfaces">Illum surfaces</h3>

<p>On an e-mail conversation, Greg Ward helped me define illum surfaces as:</p>
<blockquote align="justify"><i>Illum surfaces, also known as "impostors" or "proxies," are light-emitting surfaces whose luminous 
distributions are equivalent to the distribution transmitted through them as the consequence of the existence of other 
(direct and indirect) light sources. <a href="http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/mkillum.pdf">Mkillum</a> 
is the program that allows creating illum surfaces in a convenient way <a href="http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/book/">(Ward & Shakespeare, 1998).
</a>For example, the daylight distribution transmitted through a window, which can be considered a consequence of the existence of the sun and sky, 
can be summarized into an illum surface.</i></blockquote>
<p>Illum surfaces may be very useful when rendering and modeling luminaires in
detail. Personally, I am not
good at either of those, but I thought it was
useful to include this feature in Groundhog.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, these surfaces are not yet illum surfaces. They are
exported without any Radiance modifier
(&quot;void&quot;), so they are
invisible, and are supposed to be used for creating illums by running
mkIllum program in order to create
the actual illum.</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='kw'>if</span> <span class='const'>GH_Labeler</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_illum?'>illum?</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_face'>face</span><span class='rparen'>)</span> <span class='kw'>then</span>
	<span class='comment'>#illum is a workplane
</span><span class='kw'>else</span>
	<span class='comment'>#illum is not a workplane
</span><span class='kw'>end</span></code></pre>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Every time the “Make Window” tool is used, an illum
surface is created at the
interior side of the wall, represented in a
semi-transparent green.</p>

<h3 id="label-Result+Pixel">Result Pixel</h3>

<p>When results are imported back to SketchUp using Groundhog, a new SketchUp
group is created, which
contains several rectangles that are colored in
such way that they create a heatmap.
Each of such pixels is labeled as a
&quot;result_pixel&quot;.</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='kw'>if</span> <span class='const'>GH_Labeler</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_result_pixel?'>result_pixel?</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_face'>face</span><span class='rparen'>)</span> <span class='kw'>then</span>
	<span class='comment'>#illum is a result_pixel
</span><span class='kw'>else</span>
	<span class='comment'>#illum is not a result_pixel
</span><span class='kw'>end</span></code></pre>

<h3 id="label-Unlabeled+surfaces">Unlabeled surfaces</h3>

<p>The rest of the surfaces are the not-labeled surfaces of the scene. They
will be
exported in radiance geometry files separated by layers.</p>

<h2 id="label-Definition+Labels">Definition Labels</h2>

<h3 id="label-Solved+workplanes">Solved workplanes</h3>

<p>When results are imported back to SketchUp using Groundhog, a number of
squares (result pixels) will be packed in a group.
Such group will be
labeled as a Solved Workplane</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='kw'>if</span> <span class='const'>GH_Labeler</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_solved_workplane?'>solved_workplane?</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_component_definition'>component_definition</span><span class='rparen'>)</span> <span class='kw'>then</span>
	<span class='comment'>#component_definition is a solved_workplane
</span><span class='kw'>else</span>
	<span class='comment'>#component_definition is not a solved_workplane
</span><span class='kw'>end</span></code></pre>

<h2 id="label-Material+Labels">Material Labels</h2>

<h3 id="label-Local+materials">Local materials</h3>

<p>Local materials are SketchUp materials that contain their Radiance string
definition (i.e. primitive, modifier and arguments)
stored their
&quot;value&quot;</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='kw'>if</span> <span class='const'>GH_Labeler</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_local_material?'>local_material?</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_material'>material</span><span class='rparen'>)</span> <span class='kw'>then</span>
	<span class='comment'>#material is a local_material
</span><span class='kw'>else</span>
	<span class='comment'>#material is not a local_material
</span><span class='kw'>end</span></code></pre>
