Groundhog is a SketchUp Extension for exporting Radiance models. Developed
by Germán Molina, Sergio Vera and Waldo Bustamante.

## Contributing

Hi, if you want to contribute to Groundhog, please do it into version 1.0 (it has its own branch). 
This is a fully re-written, much better, and almost finished version (it actually works on my macOS machine)
designed to be faster, more scalable and more maintainable. It uses Emp and Emp-core as the calculation engine
(see GroundhogLighting's organization projects), which would potentially allow porting Groundhog
to other 3D modelling tools.

Thanks for your interest!

## Groundhog philosophy
The idea here is that people help on everything. From fixing the web-page and its
tutorials, to enhancing the source code and proposing new ideas on what to add,
and fill the 'To Do' section.

This is why the whole project is in an online repository.

## Install

SketchUp allows installing extensions from the "preferences" --> "extensions"--> "Install extension" menu within SketchUp. The extensions come in an RBZ file, which is provided with all the versions of Groundhog. Instructions for doing this are all over the internet. You may have got Groundhog with the complete source code which includes an RBZ file, or only the RBZ file. Either case, you have to go to SketchUp and install the extension as usual.
